# Description:
This project is a Python-based password strength checker designed to evaluate the robustness of user passwords. It assesses password strength based on multiple criteria, including length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The tool provides feedback to users, highlighting areas for improvement to create a stronger password, making it especially useful for enhancing password security.

# Key Features:
1. Length Requirement ----- Ensures that the password meets a minimum length (8 characters) for better security.

2. Character Variety: ------ Checks for the presence of:
        - Uppercase Letters: -> Adds complexity by requiring at least one uppercase letter.
        - Lowercase Letters: -> Ensures the inclusion of lowercase letters.
        - Numerals: Verifies -> that the password contains at least one numeric character.
        - Special Characters: -> Looks for special symbols (e.g., @, #, $, %, etc.) to further enhance password strength.

3. User Feedback: ----------- Provides specific guidance on missing criteria, enabling users to modify and strengthen their passwords.

4. Strength Assessment: ----- Returns a “strong password” message if all criteria are met.

# Advantages:
1. Helps users create passwords that are more resistant to brute-force and dictionary attacks.
2. Offers constructive feedback on improving password components, promoting better security practices.
3. Simple and clear criteria allow users to understand why a password is weak or strong and what changes are needed.
4. Runs efficiently, making it suitable for integration into larger applications or as a standalone script.

# Example:

Input: Password123 (weak password)

Output:
Password should contain at least one special character (@#$%^&+=).

Input: SecurePass123! (strong password)

Output:
Strong password! Well done!

# Final thoughts
This project/task can serve as a standalone security tool or be integrated into applications requiring user account setup, helping to enforce password strength policies and improve overall user account security.
